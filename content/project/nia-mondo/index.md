Nia Mondo was developed as part of the [Open Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.es/), a two-week online program where students with different backgrounds developed four open-source software projects framed in the **Sustainable Development Goals**. 

Our team was formed by five students and a coach, where most of us (including myself) had **no previous videogame development experience**. However, we developed a demo version using Unity and design software. It was a great experience since I have always wanted to try creating a videogame and, also, I had the opportunity to meet awesome people!

This 2D platformer is a proof of concept of a videogame where **your decisions matter** to achieve your objective: fight climate change! Depending on your initial choice, it will affect the playability and you will have a different ending. Okay, maybe it won't be in the next Game Awards, but who cares? we created it!

**Wanna try it? You can play directly in your browser in the [Official Project Website](https://osoc-es.github.io/nia-mondo/). Check it out!**
