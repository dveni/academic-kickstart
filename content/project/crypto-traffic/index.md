## Abstract

Internet trafﬁc classiﬁcation has become more important with the rapid growth of
crypto-currency use and crypto-mining tools, which have lead to the exposure to new threats
to end-users and companies. Most of existing approaches to perform this task use predeﬁned
features extracted by an expert in order to classify network trafﬁc. In contrast, in this study,
we propose a deep learning based approach, framed in a bigger research project named Deep
Augur, which aims to facilitate and speed up the characterisation of network ﬂows by means
of advanced Deep Neural Network techniques.
Our proposed scheme can detect the trafﬁc generated by an open-sourced crypto-miner, xmr-
stak, and a worm used for crypto-jacking, madominer, both of them used to mine Monero. The features that describe the captured
ﬂows are generated with Tstat tool. This features allow our model to detect when a trafﬁc ﬂow
belongs to crypto-mining trafﬁc. The model achieved a recall of nearly 100% and a precision
of about 98%.
