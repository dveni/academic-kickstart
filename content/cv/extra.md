  I have been actively involved in my school youth center (PLANUR, Majadahonda), organizing games and socio-cultural activities from 2014 to 2017 almost every week of the academic year. During these years, I have also taken part in summer camps organized in Salamanca.  

  I decided it would be a good idea to take the course on Leisure Activities Instructor in 2017, where I acquired new useful knowledge I would put in practice during the last summer camp I have participated in, organized by Red Cross in Toledo.  

  Since then, I have been affiliated with Red Cross participating in punctual activities not only related to leisure activities.
