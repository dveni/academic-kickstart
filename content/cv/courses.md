  This 1-week course consisted of formal lectures with lots of interaction with the students provided by an ESA Engineer from the Advanced Mission Concepts and Management Support Office of the Operations Department of ESOC, the European Space Operations Centre.  
  We took part in a group exercise in which we were asked to design a communications system for a mission, which then experienced an anomaly taken from real life. At the end of the training course, we achieved a solid understanding of the challenges of communicating with a spacecraft and the subsystems involved in communications. 
  Also, we had the opportunity to visit ESEC, part of ESA's tracking station network, that provides links between satellites in orbit and ESOC.
