I am a research intern at [Intelligent Systems Group](http://gsi.upm.es/es/) while I study my last year of MSc in Telecommunication Engineering at ETSIT, UPM. Before, I received a BSc in Telecommunication Technologies and Services from the same university, where I participated in the Erasmus+ exchange program to study abroad for one year at the Politècnico di Torino.

Welcome to my website where you will find information about me, my projects, and thoughts along my learning journey. Kind of an enhanced resume where I don't only show what I have done, but what I know. 

Currently, this website is work in progress (:
